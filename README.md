# Experience

* *Director of Engineering, ViaTRM, 2019-2020* -- Migrated into the Director of Engineering role, and took responsibility for owning the product and for working, and pushing consistently to fix functional problems, deliver needed features, and improve problematic performance issues on both the React front end and the Rails back end. I managed a small internal engineering team, worked with Product, and worked with an offshore team to get things done.
* *Senior Software Engineer, ViaTRM, 2019* -- I took over development on a Ruby/Rails project with a separate React front end, doing both front end and back end work, to help bring a very delayed and troubled software project to release, and then worked diligently to resolve customer issues and improve the software following release. I owned the front end work, the back end work, and the infrastructure work.

Managed a small team to develop an ETL tool to deal with the large volumes of logs and bounce handling tasks we generated daily.
* *Sr. Software Engineer, Mobile Engines, 1998 – 2000* -- Employee #3; integral to interview and hiring decisions for most of the engineering team. Mentoring junior developers. Tooling around CVS to enforce git-style branch based development paradigm; Perl extensions to C libraries for speech recognition. Mobile phone applications before they were cool. MySQL and Oracle DBA role.
* Software Engineer, InfoBeat, 1996 - 1998* -- Developed applications, primarily in Perl, that generated large volume customized email products. For example, products to generate customized television channel and show guides, to let customers track the specific channels and shows that they were interested in, that could generate 50k+ customized emails per hour on a single commodity Linux system; also worked with our advertising platform and developed techniques to track email opens and reads of our users, worked with Sendmail and our mail delivery engine, and did various research and development projects internally; also did some light MySQL and Oracle database administration work.
* *Systems Administrator, US West, 1995-1996* -- Worked as a system administrator for US West. I supported the design system, CImage, for our outside plant engineers, a scanner farm, and US West engineer desktops (largely Sparc 5 and Sparc 10 systems being used as desktops), as well as a variety of miscellaneous sysadmin tasks across our very large array of servers, largely comprised of Sun Microsystems machines; also internal tools to track performance and usage trends and bottlenecks with CImage.
